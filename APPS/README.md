## TODOs
- Shang
    + Apparently the sys admin needs to be able to update user info?
- Ryan S.
    + Add page for recommenders to submit their recommendation letters (not going to bother creating a user for them since they are basically one time users - instead just going to create a private link unique to each recommender with a generated pw)
    + Form validation
- Ryan F.
    + Debug faculty reviewer form submission
    + GA - add received transcripts to `transcript` table (could just be a button beside each application, "transcript received", which triggers a database insert to `transcript` table) - applicatn status page will automatically show anything you insert
    + CAC - form for determining the final decision and updating the `final_decision` table
    + Form validation

- Everyone, one week before
    + Do a run through on the server
    + Debug any database errors on the server

Anything else?
